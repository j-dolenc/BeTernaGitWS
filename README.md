## GIT

### Useful git commands

- git clone [REPO LINK]
- git init git, remote add origin when you already have a project with no git versioning.

### Git stash
- before popping or applying stash, you should commit any changes you made to the same files you stashed...


## Is this a merge error i wonder
to be or not to be that is the question.


### Branching 

bottom left, there is a button for creating branches. I am writing this in dev branch.
After you create the branch it still point to the same point as main.

To avoid merge conflicts, just use new files for your new features XD

or perhaps this is an error?

This change is here in main

## How about this
Is this ok?
